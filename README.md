Examples of things you enjoyed about or learned from this project
  - The open nature of the project where as long as we met the technical requirements we could implement anything we wanted. 
  - Using python as the server logic instead of javascript. Python has a lot of modules to streamline implementations.
  - How to serve users files for download

Examples of things you didnâ€™t enjoy or wanted to learn from this project
  - The python module used as the download client spotdl does not have up to date information on developer or API usage.
    Due to this we had to use spotdl from the command line with os.system(spotd --args url).
